# Code book

This is the code book for the data in the file mean_dataset.txt.

The raw motion data was gathered in the UCI HAR Dataset which is a 
mobile device dataset generated by motion tracking 20 subjects through 6
different activities.   To read about the experimental conditions, visit this

## Raw data description

(this is copied from the original feature_info.txt)

Feature Selection

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz.

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag).

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals).

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.


## Tidy data description

The R script **run_analysis.R**, included in this repository, generates the 
tidy data set containing mean values of "mean" measurements per subject and per activity.   The summary is saved in the file **mean_dataset.txt**.

The full list of column names in **mean_dataset.txt** is:

Column | Description
--------- | ----------
subject | an id from 1 to 30
activity | what the subject was doing (LAYING, SITTING, STANDING, WALKING, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, WALKING_UPSTAIRS)
TimeBodyAccelerometerMeanX | for all following data, mean values of the column indicated
TimeBodyAccelerometerMeanY
TimeBodyAccelerometerMeanZ
